## 🩸 ACT I — “The Call of the Tide” (~30 min)

**Location:** Cliffside approach → Asylum exterior → Flooded main hall

Elara arrives during a violent storm. You control her from the car to the asylum’s gates. The road collapses behind her, cutting off escape. Every lightning strike briefly illuminates humanoid shapes watching from the cliffs.

**Gameplay:**

* Tutorial mechanics: flashlight, battery use, tape recorder saves
* Simple environmental puzzles (find fuse, open door)
* Exploration of exterior grounds — a flooded courtyard, broken fences, rusted machinery
* First encounter with the **Drowned One’s reflection** in a window

**Key Scene:**
She finds her own name written on the asylum sign-in ledger, dated *June 7, 1971*.

**Tone:** Cold, investigative, but uneasy. The ocean feels sentient.
**Goal:** Reach the generator and restore power to access the archives.

---

## 🧠 ACT II — “The Memory Depths” (~35 min)

**Location:** East Wing → Therapy wards → Research labs

Power returns — the asylum wakes up. The hum of old generators becomes rhythmic, almost like breathing.

**Gameplay:**

* Stealth introduced (hiding in lockers, under beds)
* AI stalker patrol patterns
* First real chase sequence — The Drowned One crawls from flooded ducts
* Collect **mirror shards** (used to trigger flashback visions)

**Narrative:**
Elara finds a **recording of her mother** discussing “Mirror Sleep.” Patients were submerged in saltwater tanks to record their dreams. One subject heard something calling to her from *beneath the tide of thought*.

**Key Moment:**
The first hallucination — Elara sees herself as a patient strapped to a therapy chair, briefly switching perspectives.

**Goal:** Collect 3 keycards to unlock the sealed lab elevator.

---

## 🌀 ACT III — “The Flood Within” (~40 min)

**Location:** Submerged lower wards → Mirror Sleep chamber

Elara descends into the therapy wing. The further she goes, the less stable reality becomes. Walls pulse like flesh. Flooded hallways reflect distorted memories.

**Gameplay:**

* Sanity mechanic fully active
* Vision distortion, echoing whispers, fake enemy spawns
* Puzzle: restore pressure valves to drain flooded corridors
* Sequence where Elara must follow **whispers of her mother** — some lead her to safety, others into traps

**Narrative:**
Elara uncovers the truth — her mother created the Mirror Sleep to cure her own grief after Elara’s supposed death. Elara realizes *she is the copied consciousness of that child*, resurrected in data and dreams.

**Key Scene:**
She replays a recording where her mother says:

> “If she can dream, she can live again.”

**Goal:** Activate the Mirror Sleep tank to enter the shared subconscious realm.

---

## 🌊 ACT IV — “The Dream Below” (~35 min)

**Location:** Abstract oceanic dreamscape — memory fragments, floating ruins

Inside the dream realm, the asylum merges with an endless underwater void. Rooms drift in black water. Furniture floats midair. Gravity bends.

**Gameplay:**

* Nonlinear exploration: each memory fragment changes the environment
* Encounters become psychological — Elara’s reflection taunts her
* Sanity mechanic tied to truth — facing painful memories restores sanity, running away reduces it
* Dream puzzles: rearrange environments, align reflections, follow heartbeat sounds

**Narrative:**
Elara meets echoes of patients — trapped minds, each representing failed experiments. They speak in broken sentences, pleading for release.
She realizes the Drowned One is not an enemy — it’s the merged consciousness of the forgotten patients, protecting the dream from collapse.

**Key Scene:**
Inverted chase — the entity flees from *her*, terrified she’ll wake it all up.

**Goal:** Reach the Lighthouse, where the final memory waits.

---

## ⚡ ACT V — “The Awakening” (~40 min)

**Location:** The Lighthouse → Collapsing sea of consciousness

The lighthouse is revealed as a massive neural node — the core of Mirror Sleep. Lightning illuminates the sea of faces beneath the waves. The Drowned One reveals the truth: the real Elara died decades ago. This Elara was reconstructed from dream memory — she’s a ghost of thought, and the ocean is her mind.

**Gameplay:**

* Final confrontation sequence
* Dynamic sanity and decision system — hallucinations rewrite level geometry
* Multiple ending paths unlocked by sanity %, memory fragments collected, and choices during whispers dialogue

**Endings:**

1. **Merge (True Ending):** Elara accepts the truth, joins her mother and the souls in the sea. Calm silence follows.
2. **Escape (False Ending):** She destroys the lighthouse and wakes on the shore. The world looks normal — until her reflection blinks independently.
3. **Erasure (Hidden Ending):** She loses all sanity. The player replays the intro scene — but now Elara’s name isn’t on the ledger. She never existed.

**Credits roll** over the sound of distant ocean waves and static tape distortion.

## 🎧 Tone Summary

> “You came here searching for truth. But the truth doesn’t float. It sinks.”

---

Would you like me to make this 3-hour story **ready for implementation** next — like with level-by-level **mission flow**, **cutscene dialogue**, and **Blueprint trigger events** for Unreal Engine 4.26? That’ll turn this into a playable story structure.
